# Blum AI Financial Intelligence Roadmap

This roadmap is the execution plan for turning Blum into a credible open-source AI financial intelligence platform. Each phase should ship with working code, API coverage, UI coverage, documentation and explicit limitations.

## Current Increment - Market Brain And IPO Intelligence

Shipped in the current architecture:

- FastAPI startup launches a background APScheduler worker.
- Startup pipeline ingests public news first, then historical OHLCV, signals and ETF trends.
- Startup pipeline also scans SEC current filing feeds for IPO and prospectus evidence.
- Public news ingestion combines publisher RSS feeds, thematic Google News RSS queries and asset-specific public web-search RSS queries.
- `/news/live`, `/sentiment/market` and `/pipeline/status` expose live news, market sentiment and worker state.
- Dashboard polls live endpoints every 30 seconds and surfaces news tape, sentiment mix, source/model state and signal readiness.
- Price pipeline remains real-data-only through yfinance, Yahoo Chart API and Stooq; no synthetic OHLCV fallback is allowed.
- Stock Radar is now a first-class research surface with dedicated API, on-demand stock hydration, sector leadership, factor views, research priorities and real market snapshots.
- IPO Radar is now a first-class primary-market research surface using SEC EDGAR current filing feeds for S-1, F-1 and 424B prospectus forms.
- Market Brain is now the top-level orchestration layer combining stock signals, ETF rotation, market sentiment, public news, IPO evidence, forward scenarios, risk alerts and an evidence ledger.
- Market Brain now persists snapshot history, produces a changelog against the prior run, detects price/news/risk contradictions and emits an event graph linking themes, assets, ETFs, IPO candidates and live news.
- IPO Radar now supports official `data.sec.gov` company submissions enrichment by CIK, with optional persistence of additional IPO-related filings.
- Theme Explorer now supports theme detail with article list, source mix, linked assets and sentiment.
- The signal engine now records score version, confidence score and lifecycle state for every signal snapshot.
- `/ai/models/status` exposes configured models, observed model records and fallback policy.
- Blum Financial Brain now adds a finance-domain open model adapter. The configured default is `AdaptLLM/finance-chat`, opt-in for model loading, with deterministic evidence-bound fallback on constrained demo hardware.
- `/market-brain`, `/market-brain/run`, `/ipo-radar` and `/ipo-radar/update` expose the new intelligence layer through documented JSON APIs.
- The Accuracy And Confidence Layer now implements the 15-point audit: multi-provider checks, corporate-action review, point-in-time consistency, per-asset data quality, entity resolution, source credibility, semantic dedupe, event extraction, AI reasoning confidence, contradictions, fundamentals, macro context, ETF confirmation, historical validation and Blum Confidence Score.
- `/accuracy/overview`, `/accuracy/{ticker}`, `/accuracy/run`, `/validation/signals`, `/macro/overview`, `/macro/update`, `/fundamentals/{ticker}` and `/fundamentals/update` expose confidence, macro and fundamental evidence through JSON APIs.
- Startup and background workers now seed accuracy snapshots, repair historical OHLCV gaps, refresh public FRED macro data and refresh SEC companyfacts fundamentals where public CIK mapping is available.

## Phase 0 - Stabilize Docker Space Deployment

Goal: make the Hugging Face Docker Space build and boot reliably.

Deliverables:

- Confirm Docker build succeeds on Hugging Face Spaces.
- Verify FastAPI serves the exported Next.js frontend on port `7860`.
- Verify embedded PostgreSQL starts when `DATABASE_URL` is not provided.
- Verify `/health`, `/docs`, `/assets` and `/dashboard/overview`.

Exit criteria:

- Public Space loads without manual intervention.
- API docs are reachable.
- Seed asset universe is visible.
- No Gradio remnants remain in runtime metadata.

## Phase 1 - Data Ingestion Reliability

Goal: make prices, assets and news ingestion reliable enough for a serious demo.

Deliverables:

- Harden yfinance provider with retries, partial failures and provider status.
- Keep real-data-only behavior: no synthetic OHLCV fallback in production or demo paths.
- Maintain a public provider chain for prices: yfinance, Yahoo Chart API and Stooq.
- Add incremental OHLCV updates instead of replacing recent rows blindly.
- Improve RSS source health diagnostics.
- Add article text extraction fallback with `newspaper3k` and BeautifulSoup.

## Working Rule

Every roadmap step should ship as a complete increment:

- backend logic;
- API endpoint or schema update when needed;
- frontend visibility when user-facing;
- documentation update;
- verification command;
- explicit limitation or disclaimer when relevant.

All implementation work must follow [`ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`](ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md): no placeholders, no fabricated data, no synthetic market-data fallback, evidence-bound AI, efficient provider calls and explicit verification.
