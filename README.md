# BLUM v2.0 Project Split

## BLUM v2.1 Clean Core Release

BLUM v2.1 tightens the v2.0 split around the four product surfaces that matter to the trader brain:

1. **Brain**: answers whether BLUM is becoming a better trading decision system.
2. **Training Ground**: shows what the Learning Loop is studying and what evidence it has accumulated.
3. **Paper Trading**: shows auditable paper decisions, outcomes and copyability evidence.
4. **Alpha**: shows whether BLUM is beating realistic benchmarks with sufficient evidence.

The release is intentionally a cleanup sprint, not a new financial-feature sprint. The main change is dependency direction:

`Frontend product page -> bounded router -> BLUM Engine facade -> Engine read model -> stored evidence`

New bounded routers live under `backend/app/api/routers/`:

- `brain.py`
- `training.py`
- `paper_trading.py`
- `alpha.py`
- `runtime.py`
- `analyst.py`
- `legacy.py`

The old `backend/app/api/routes.py` is still mounted last as a legacy compatibility router. Do not add new product endpoints there.

The Trader Brain read model was moved from `backend/app/services/trader_brain.py` to `backend/app/engine/brain/trader_brain.py`. The old path remains as a compatibility shim so existing tests, jobs and legacy routes continue to work.

### v2.1 Clean-Core Rules

- Product routes must call `BlumEngineFacade`, not low-level services.
- Runtime routes own application state, snapshots, health and diagnostics, not financial truth.
- Analyst routes expose dataset/model-boundary contracts, not market-data authority.
- Frontend product navigation stays reduced to Brain, Training, Paper Trading and Alpha.
- Legacy endpoints remain available, but new code should move behind bounded routers and facades.

### Agent-Based Engine Structure

BLUM now exposes a lightweight cooperative-agent boundary inside the Engine. Agents are not UI components and do not start jobs. They publish structured evidence that other Engine components can inspect.

Implemented agent boundaries:

- Market Agent
- News Agent
- Technical Agent
- Fundamental Agent
- Pattern Agent
- Decision Agent
- Risk Agent
- Portfolio Agent
- Paper Trading Agent
- Learning Agent
- Research Agent
- Memory Agent
- Alpha Agent
- Validation Agent
- Dataset Agent

Endpoint:

- `GET /api/engine/agents`

Optional query parameters:

- `agent=learning_agent`
- `agent=alpha_agent`
- `limit=8`

Design rule: no empty agent wrappers. Each registered agent owns a real evidence collection responsibility and returns a structured payload with status, evidence type, sample size, confidence and warnings where available.

Additional sprint documents:

- `CLEAN_CORE_REPORT_v2.1.md`
- `MIGRATION_v2.1.md`
- `DEPRECATION_REPORT.md`

---

BLUM is now organized as a Financial Intelligence Operating System with three independent layers:

1. **BLUM Engine**: the headless source of truth. It owns learning, decisions, alpha validation, paper trading, portfolio intelligence, confidence calibration, meta-learning, historical memory and dataset export.
2. **BLUM Analyst**: the future trainable reasoning model hosted as `Italianhype/Blum-Analyst`. It learns how BLUM reasons from curated Engine datasets. It does not own market data and is never the source of truth.
3. **BLUM Runtime**: the application layer. It owns API delivery, scheduling, snapshots, observability and the product interface. It asks the Engine; it never decides.

The operating principle is strict:

`Market -> Engine evidence -> Decision -> Paper outcome -> Learning -> Better Engine decision -> Analyst dataset -> Validated reasoning assistant`

The Runtime is replaceable. The Engine must continue learning if the frontend disappears.

## v2.0 Layer Contracts

New contract endpoints:

- `GET /api/engine/status`
- `GET /api/engine/contracts`
- `GET /api/runtime/status`
- `GET /api/runtime/contracts`
- `GET /api/analyst/status`
- `GET /api/architecture/contracts`

The split is intentionally backward-compatible. Existing APIs remain available, but new development must follow the layer boundary:

| Layer | Owns | Must Not Own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Engine | financial truth, decisions, learning, alpha evidence, paper outcomes, knowledge, datasets | frontend, pages, visual state, product navigation |
| Analyst | reasoning model dataset contract and future model-training target | market data truth, execution, database authority |
| Runtime | API, workers, scheduler, snapshots, cache, monitoring, pages | intelligence, alpha logic, trade decisions |

  NextUI --> FastAPI --> Snapshots
```

## v2.0 Rules

- Engine is the only source of truth.
- Runtime reads contracts and snapshots; it never owns intelligence.
- Analyst learns reasoning only; Engine validates all Analyst output.
- No frontend render may trigger training, recalculation or heavy intelligence.
- No source-code self-modification.
- No real broker execution.
- No alpha claim without benchmark-relative evidence.

## v2.0 Migration Notes

The current codebase still contains legacy services under `backend/app/services` for compatibility. v2.0 introduces the durable split through:

- `backend/app/engine`: Engine contracts and headless facade.
- `backend/app/runtime`: Runtime contracts and application facade.
- `backend/app/analyst`: Analyst dataset/model-boundary contracts.

Future migrations should move legacy service implementations behind these boundaries module by module. New code should not import intelligence services directly from product pages or runtime endpoints unless it is adapting them behind an Engine contract.

# BLUM v1.1.0 Trader Brain

BLUM is no longer organized as a collection of financial dashboards. BLUM is an autonomous trader-brain research system whose only product objective is to become progressively better at making paper-trading decisions through evidence, outcomes, learning and self-correction.

The runtime philosophy is:

`Market -> Analysis -> Decision -> Paper Trade -> Outcome -> Learning -> Better Decision -> Repeat`

Everything else is internal infrastructure.

## Product Surface

BLUM now exposes only four primary pages:

1. **Brain**: answers whether BLUM is becoming a better trader.
2. **Training Ground**: shows what the Learning Loop is testing, rejecting and learning.
3. **Paper Trading**: shows conditional paper-only decisions, outcomes and lessons.
4. **Alpha**: answers whether BLUM is beating benchmarks with sufficient evidence.

Legacy pages and diagnostic modules are retained for compatibility and engineering inspection, but they are no longer primary product pages. The frontend is a snapshot-first observer. It must not trigger training, recalculation, broker actions or heavy backend work during page render.

## Master Scores

BLUM v1.1.0 introduces a Trader Brain read model:

- **Brain Score**: decision quality, evidence quality, calibration, learning stability, risk management, alpha readiness, reproducibility, explainability, market coverage, portfolio intelligence and knowledge quality.
- **Decision Quality**: quality of the decision process, not just whether the outcome won.
- **Learning Velocity**: how quickly validated knowledge improves per experiment.
- **Knowledge Quality**: validated lessons and meta-cognition evidence, not raw data volume.
- **Alpha Readiness**: strict benchmark-relative evidence with sample-size and live-evidence gates.

## AI Model Routing

Blum does not use one generic AI model for everything.

- FinBERT: financial sentiment for headlines, article summaries and company-linked news.
- VADER: baseline comparator and fallback.
- sentence-transformers: embeddings for semantic search, narrative clustering, recurring themes and links between assets, sectors and macro trends.
- Qwen-compatible lightweight LLM: structured explanations from retrieved evidence only.
- Blum Financial Brain: finance-domain reasoning adapter for regime interpretation, opportunity hypotheses, risk hypotheses and monitoring plans.
- Chart Vision Technical Analyst: Qwen3-VL primary VLM for visual chart interpretation when configured, InternVL3 fallback for low-confidence or failed primary visual reads.
- Deterministic Technical Analysis Engine: OHLCV-derived trend structure, levels, moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR, volume, gaps, divergences, volatility compression and risk/reward.
- Statistical time-series module: anomalies, volatility regimes and scenario bands, ready for Chronos, TimesFM or PatchTST integration.
- Rule-based quantitative engine: scoring, ranking, risk controls and classifications.

## Data Workflow

1. Seed the asset universe with stocks, ETFs, sectors, countries, industries and descriptions.
2. Download OHLCV price history from yfinance, Yahoo Chart API and Stooq public daily data, using maximum available history when requested.
3. Store prices in PostgreSQL.
4. Start the live pipeline on application boot.
5. Fetch public RSS news plus dynamic public web-search RSS queries for assets and financial themes.
6. Deduplicate articles.
7. Link articles to tickers and sectors.
8. Run FinBERT sentiment and VADER baseline.
9. Generate embeddings for semantic retrieval.
10. Compute technical indicators and time-series anomalies.
11. Generate signal snapshots with a Blum Intelligence Score.
12. Scan SEC EDGAR current filings for IPO and final prospectus evidence.
13. Score IPO/pre-listing candidates through a separate readiness, probability, narrative and risk model.
14. Build a Market Brain snapshot that combines stocks, ETFs, news, sentiment, IPO evidence, scenarios and risk alerts.
15. Run the 15-point accuracy and confidence audit.
16. Build the Strategic Intelligence dashboard: opportunity radar, narrative, watchlist alerts, portfolio scenario and similar-case validation.
17. Evaluate matured signal outcomes after 1D, 3D, 7D, 14D and 30D.
18. Update signal accuracy memory, source reliability, ticker/sector profiles and adaptive confidence adjustments.
19. Version scoring weights in the database when real matured outcomes justify recalibration.
20. Generate professional chart analysis from deterministic OHLCV evidence and optional Qwen3-VL/InternVL3 visual interpretation.
21. Persist chart analyses, technical levels, technical signals and chart pattern memory.
22. Run BLUM Learning Loop point-in-time simulations on random historical asset/date samples.
23. Hide future prices during prediction generation, then reveal future OHLCV only during outcome evaluation.
24. Classify mistakes, update strategy memory, recalibrate signal reliability and persist reversible model-weight versions.
25. Convert prediction memory into execution-quality R-multiple learning through the Market Sniper Engine.
26. Run the Reproducible Trading Game with 100 EUR paper capital, risk-managed sizing, P/L tracking and benchmark comparison.
27. Run the Reasoning Precision Core: thesis survival, conviction decay, bull/bear/neutral thesis competition, benchmark-relative evaluation, engine voting and training-data quality scoring.
28. Produce AI explanations using only retrieved evidence.

## Live Runtime

When the FastAPI application starts, APScheduler launches a background intelligence worker:

- `startup_pipeline`: news ingestion, historical price collection, signal generation and ETF trend update.
- `news_refresh`: public news refresh every 10 minutes by default.
- `market_refresh`: recent OHLCV refresh and signal regeneration every 45 minutes by default.
- `ipo_refresh`: SEC current filing refresh every 120 minutes by default.
- `data_gap_repair`: historical OHLCV continuity repair every 180 minutes by default.
- `accuracy_audit`: 15-point confidence audit every 240 minutes by default.
- `macro_refresh`: FRED public macro context refresh every 240 minutes by default.
- `fundamentals_refresh`: SEC companyfacts refresh every 720 minutes by default.
- `financial_brain_learning`: self-learning evaluation, memory refresh and confidence calibration every 360 minutes by default.
- `blum_point_in_time_learning_loop`: random historical point-in-time simulation, outcome evaluation and strategy-memory refresh every 360 minutes by default.
- `market_sniper_engine`: conditional setup actionability, entry/exit plans, no-trade decisions, execution simulations and R-multiple reliability memory during each autonomous research cycle.

The dashboard polls live JSON endpoints every 30 seconds and shows worker state, latest public news, sentiment distribution, source/model diagnostics and signal readiness. No generated headlines, generated prices or fabricated sentiment are shown.

Every equity and ETF surface includes an explicit market snapshot when real OHLCV data is available: last price, currency, date, provider, volume and 1D/5D/1M performance. If public providers have not returned usable prices yet, the UI shows a real-data pending state instead of a fabricated value.

## Performance Diagnostics

Blum includes a `/performance` diagnostics page focused on measurement before optimization.

The backend instruments:

- FastAPI request timing for every endpoint through middleware.
- SQLAlchemy query timing for every database statement through engine listeners.
- Application startup phases, including database bootstrap and realtime-service startup.
- APScheduler/background worker durations, including startup pipeline, market refresh, news refresh, learning loop and trading game jobs.
- Dashboard widget timings for the main command-center payload.
- Browser-side dashboard widget probes from the diagnostics page.

The diagnostics API is available at `/performance/diagnostics`. It reports startup duration breakdown, slowest endpoints, slowest SQL queries, slowest dashboard widgets, average and p95 response times, cache hit rate, dashboard snapshot freshness, background task durations, rowcount/scan visibility, initial Learning page load requests, duplicate request counts, heavy POST calls triggered during page load and the top 10 measured bottlenecks.

Rows scanned are reported conservatively: DBAPI cursor timing is exact, but exact scanned rows require `EXPLAIN/ANALYZE`. The diagnostics layer does not run optimizer probes automatically, so it exposes driver rowcount when available and marks unknown scan depth explicitly.

## Performance Architecture

The Learning / Trading Intelligence surface is snapshot-first and read-only by default. It is designed so frontend visualization never interferes with backend learning, training, Trading Game, Reasoning Core, Capital Allocation or Decision Intelligence jobs.

- Overview: loads only `GET /api/learning-intelligence/summary` on first render.
- Trading Game: loads only when the user opens the tab, with paginated ledger defaults and latest 25 trades.
- Deep Diagnostics: all model, thesis, reliability, training-quality, decision, business, portfolio, capital-allocation and performance panels stay behind explicit `Load panel` actions.

The frontend request wrapper deduplicates in-flight GET requests, applies request timeouts, keeps a short in-memory route-session cache and reports Learning-page browser timings, cache hits and dedupe events to Performance Diagnostics. Heavy recalculation POST endpoints are not called automatically during Learning page render. During the initial Learning render window, accidental heavy POST calls are blocked and logged as `blocked_heavy_frontend_recalculation`.

Dashboard snapshots provide stale-but-usable payloads for fast UI surfaces. The snapshot API is `/api/dashboard-snapshots/{snapshot_type}`. The startup status API is `/startup/status`, allowing the UI to distinguish API readiness from background warm-up.

Trading Game runtime surfaces now use dedicated snapshots for the expensive read paths:

- `trading_game_ledger_snapshot` backs `GET /api/trading-game/ledger`.
- `equity_curve_snapshot` backs `GET /api/trading-game/equity/annotated`.
- `dashboard_overview_summary` backs `GET /dashboard/overview`.

Each Trading Game snapshot stores payload size, object counts and phase timings for base query, attribution loading, evidence loading, benchmark loading, quality loading, prediction loading, serialization and JSON generation. If a snapshot is stale, the UI can still show it with a warning instead of recalculating during page render.

The Trading Game extraction audit is documented in `TRADING_GAME_NPLUS1_REPORT.md`.

Blum prioritizes fast visible intelligence first, then progressive deep detail. Existing APIs, tables, Learning Loop logic, Trading Game logic and Decision Intelligence logic remain backward compatible.

## Lightweight Learning Control Room

The Learning page is intentionally reduced to three modes:

- **Overview = fast truth.** One lightweight summary endpoint returns Learning Loop status, latest run timestamp, Trading Power Score, capital cycle, current capital, win rate, expectancy R, benchmark summary, live-vs-historical state, top weakness, latest lesson, Truth Panel, backend training status and last snapshot timestamp.
- **Trading Game = focused evidence.** The tab loads equity curve, cycle progress, latest 25 ledger rows, win/loss/missed-entry summary, benchmark summary and reality-check warnings only after the user opens it.
- **Deep Diagnostics = optional advanced analysis.** Heavy reasoning/model panels never load automatically. Each panel has its own explicit load action and failure state.

Backend learning remains independent through APScheduler/autonomous jobs or explicit manual actions. The frontend observes snapshots and evidence; it does not train, recalculate, repair data or run pipelines during page render. If snapshots are stale while background recalculation is running, the UI shows the last snapshot timestamp and a stale-data warning instead of blocking first paint.

The production scheduler runs professional learning as four independent lanes: Financial Brain learning, Financial Model learning, point-in-time Learning Loop and Trading Game evidence. They share the configured professional cadence but use staggered first-run offsets, independent worker state and failure isolation. Market refresh never invokes these lanes, and snapshot/Brain evidence refreshes remain separate workers. This prevents duplicate computation and avoids the former multi-minute `blum_professional_learning_cycle` mega-job.

The autonomous scheduler lane now persists the next research plan only. Market data, news, model learning, replay, paper trading and snapshots continue through their dedicated workers. The backward-compatible `run_professional_learning_cycle_job` entry point remains available as one bounded point-in-time slice, but it is not the scheduled production orchestrator.

Professional learning configuration:

```bash
export BLUM_PROFESSIONAL_LEARNING_ENABLED=true
export BLUM_PROFESSIONAL_LEARNING_MINUTES=30
export BLUM_PROFESSIONAL_LEARNING_BATCH_SIZE=20
```

The Learning Loop still enforces anti-overfitting budgets. When a requested batch would exceed `LEARNING_MAX_DAILY_RUNS`, BLUM now consumes the remaining daily budget as a smaller partial batch. Only a fully exhausted daily budget is reported as `budget_wait`, not as a silent skipped training failure.

## Deep Diagnostics UX

Deep Diagnostics remains lazy-loaded and human-readable by default. Each advanced panel is opened explicitly with `Load panel`; no model, thesis, reliability, training-quality, decision, business, portfolio, capital-allocation or performance payload is fetched during the initial Learning Overview render.

Diagnostic payloads are rendered as analytical summaries instead of API dumps:

- metric cards expose the headline state, sample size and core scores;
- evidence badges and reliability badges mark weak evidence, stale state and warning conditions;
- Reliability by Regime renders a summary plus engine/signal/setup/regime tables;
- Ensemble Status renders active engine counts, highest/lowest weighted engines, weight distribution and disagreement warnings;
- unknown or newer diagnostic payloads fall back to a clean key-value summary and capped table view;
- raw JSON is hidden behind `Show raw JSON` for developer inspection only.

Weak sample sizes are treated as first-class evidence warnings. Deep Diagnostics is designed to answer what the payload means, whether the evidence is strong or weak, whether BLUM appears to be improving, what warning matters most and what should be checked next.

## Accuracy And Confidence Layer

Blum separates opportunity scoring from evidence quality. The **Blum Intelligence Score** ranks research candidates. The **Blum Confidence Score** measures whether the evidence behind an asset is complete, current and internally consistent.

The 15-point audit covers multi-provider price validation, corporate-action review, point-in-time consistency, per-asset data quality, entity resolution, source credibility, semantic news deduplication, structured event extraction, confidence-aware AI reasoning, contradiction checks, SEC fundamentals where available, FRED macro context, sector/ETF confirmation, historical signal validation and the final confidence label.

Missing public data lowers confidence instead of creating placeholders. No synthetic prices, headlines, filings, fundamentals, macro values or scores are generated.

## Strategic Intelligence Layer

Blum now exposes an **AI Market Intelligence Officer** surface. It answers: what should be monitored today, why it matters, which data confirms it and which risks limit conviction.

Strategic modules:

- **AI Opportunity Radar** ranks equities and ETFs for research attention using opportunity, trend, momentum, sentiment, news and risk scores.
- **Market Narrative AI** summarizes the dominant theme, emerging subthemes, beneficiary sectors, macro risks and contrary signals.
- **Asset Intelligence Report** builds a professional asset brief with overview, technical levels, sentiment, recent news, bullish/bearish scenarios, risks and similar-case validation.
- **Similar-Case Backtesting** uses real stored OHLCV when enough history exists. If sample depth is insufficient, it returns `demonstration_mode` statistics clearly labeled as non-production evidence.
- **Strategic Watchlist** stores monitored assets, score baseline, alert rules and simulated alerts.
- **AI Portfolio Scenario** produces a non-consultative hypothetical allocation with rationale, risk context, monitoring plan and defensive alternative.
- **Community & Sentiment Intelligence** summarizes public-news sentiment themes, discussed assets and possible hype-bubble review flags.

The wording policy explicitly avoids `buy`, `sell`, guaranteed profit or trading instructions. Surfaces use language such as monitor, observe, setup, scenario, risk review and research candidate.

## BLUM Chat

BLUM Chat is the conversational voice of the Blum analytical engine. It is not a generic chatbot and it must not force an answer. It detects the user language, validates the requested entity, retrieves only relevant Blum evidence and speaks in a concise analyst style when data is missing.

Supported languages:

- Italian
- English
- German
- French
- Spanish

The chat pipeline:

1. Detects the user language.
2. Detects intent: technical analysis, fundamental analysis, full analysis, comparison, opportunity search, narrative analysis, reasoning-memory question, private-company request, unknown-asset request, educational question, portfolio question or chatbot debug feedback.
3. Extracts and classifies entities as public stock, ETF, index, crypto, private company, ambiguous company, unknown asset or general market topic.
4. Validates that the resolved ticker matches the requested entity and that OHLCV exists before producing technical analysis.
5. Blocks unsupported analysis instead of substituting unrelated tickers. For example, SpaceX and OpenAI are treated as private companies; BLUM can discuss listed proxies but cannot invent direct RSI, MACD or support/resistance levels.
6. Retrieves Blum context only after validation: ranking, signals, OHLCV snapshots, deterministic technical analysis, SEC companyfacts fundamentals, news, sentiment, narratives, semantic evidence, learning memory and Reasoning Precision Core memory.
7. Selects a response builder by intent instead of using one universal template. Simple missing-data questions get concise answers; validated public assets get structured analysis.
8. Runs a quality gate for language match, entity match, duplicate tickers, data availability, impossible technical analysis, repeated sections and disclaimer discipline.
9. Stores chat sessions and messages in PostgreSQL for future personalization and training-memory workflows.

Response-builder modules include:

- `build_private_company_response()`
- `build_technical_analysis_response()`
- `build_fundamental_analysis_response()`
- `build_full_analysis_response()`
- `build_comparison_response()`
- `build_opportunity_search_response()`
- `build_reasoning_memory_response()`
- `build_error_response()`

Debug diagnostics are hidden by default. When `mode=debug`, `mode=developer` or `mode=chatbot_debug_feedback`, the API can return detected language, detected intent, entity resolution, validation result, duplicate count, data freshness and response template used.

BLUM Chat includes an internal **Market Sniper Mode**. This is a selective research mode, not a trading signal. It identifies informational setup zones, confirmation conditions, invalidation, target zones, risk/reward geometry, confidence and what could go wrong. It never presents an order and never guarantees an outcome.

Open-source model interface:

- `LLMProvider` contract for OpenAI-compatible APIs, local models, Hugging Face Inference, Ollama, vLLM and llama.cpp.
- Deterministic evidence-bound fallback when no external model is configured.
- Future-compatible with Llama, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, Phi, FinGPT and finance models hosted on Hugging Face.

Chat persistence tables:

- `chat_sessions`
- `chat_messages`

Primary endpoints:

- `POST /api/chat`
- `GET /api/chat/context`
- `GET /api/chat/assets/{ticker}`
- `GET /api/chat/signals/{ticker}`
- `GET /api/chat/history`
- Legacy compatible: `POST /chat/financial`

## Self-Learning Financial Brain

Blum now includes a measurable self-learning layer called **Blum Financial Brain**. This is not artificial consciousness and not autonomous trading. It is a controlled financial intelligence memory that checks whether prior signals were useful after real market outcomes arrive.

The learning engine evaluates each signal after:

- 1 trading-day horizon proxy;
- 3-day horizon;
- 7-day horizon;
- 14-day horizon;
- 30-day horizon.

Each evaluation stores ticker, signal type, initial confidence, initial sentiment, initial momentum, news evidence, expected direction, price at signal, price after horizon, max drawdown, max upside, realized return, post-signal volatility, outcome, explanation quality and data quality.

The memory layer persists:

- `signal_evaluations`
- `signal_outcomes`
- `model_weight_versions`
- `learning_events`
- `historical_similarity_cases`
- `confidence_adjustments`
- `source_reliability_scores`
- `ticker_accuracy_profiles`
- `sector_accuracy_profiles`

Adaptive confidence combines historical accuracy, sector and ticker memory, linked source reliability, price/news coherence, volatility and similar past cases. The system can increase or reduce confidence, but every adjustment is logged and explainable.

Weight recalibration is database-only and reversible. Blum can create a new `model_weight_versions` row after enough matured outcomes exist, but it does not modify source code, execute trades or generate deterministic financial recommendations. If there is not enough historical evidence, it explicitly returns `insufficient_sample`.

The UI exposes:

- Dashboard: Financial Brain status, learning state, historical accuracy, 7D/30D success rate, calibration, best/weakest signal types, data quality and drift warning.
- Asset Detail: Blum Memory, historical similarity, confidence evolution, outcome history and what was learned.
- Signal Lab: pre-signal confidence, post-evaluation result, learning impact, weight status, similar past evidence and invalidating conditions.

Governance rules are enforced in product language and API output: no absolute certainty, no direct financial advice, no autonomous trading, no self-modifying code and clear separation between observed data, inference and hypothesis.

## BLUM Learning Loop

BLUM Learning Loop is a separate point-in-time simulation lab. It does not try to create a fake 100% win rate. Its objective is to improve statistical edge, reduce false positives, calibrate confidence and document which reasoning patterns work or fail under different regimes.

Each cycle:

1. Selects a random active stock or ETF with sufficient stored historical OHLCV.
2. Selects a historical analysis date with enough future data available for later evaluation.
3. Builds a point-in-time packet using only data known on or before that date.
4. Generates short, mid and long horizon predictions.
5. Persists the forecast before outcome evaluation.
6. Reveals future OHLCV only to evaluate the forecast.
7. Measures direction correctness, target hit, invalidation hit, max favorable excursion, max adverse excursion, drawdown, realized return, false positives, false negatives, missed opportunities and confidence calibration.
8. Classifies mistakes such as weak volume confirmation, sentiment overestimation, volatility expansion, support/resistance failure, overconfidence or insufficient data.
9. Updates strategy memory and signal-factor reliability.
10. Writes a new model-weight version when enough historical outcomes justify a gradual recalibration.

New persistence tables:

- `learning_runs`
- `historical_predictions`
- `prediction_outcomes`
- `mistake_analysis`
- `signal_performance`
- `strategy_memory`
- `model_versions`
- `learning_metrics`

Configuration:

```bash
export LEARNING_LOOP_ENABLED=true
export LEARNING_BATCH_SIZE=100
export LEARNING_MAX_DAILY_RUNS=1000
export BLUM_PROFESSIONAL_LEARNING_ENABLED=true
export BLUM_PROFESSIONAL_LEARNING_MINUTES=30
export BLUM_PROFESSIONAL_LEARNING_BATCH_SIZE=20
export LEARNING_RANDOM_SEED=
export LEARNING_MIN_HISTORY_YEARS=3
export LEARNING_ASSET_UNIVERSE=stocks,etfs
export LEARNING_EVALUATION_MODE=walk_forward
```

The loop includes anti-overfitting controls:

- temporal point-in-time sampling;
- walk-forward evaluation;
- sample-size guardrails;
- multi-ticker, multi-sector and multi-regime coverage metrics;
- warnings for suspiciously perfect small-sample hit rates;
- confidence updates that are gradual and reversible;
- no self-modifying source code;
- no autonomous trading.

The chatbot reads BLUM Learning Loop memory when answering setup-quality questions such as: “This setup has worked in the past?”, “What is the historical false-positive risk?”, “What has BLUM learned about this pattern?” and “Which factor should reduce confidence?”.

## Market Sniper Engine

The **Market Sniper Engine** upgrades BLUM from “interesting asset” detection to conditional actionability analysis. It does not issue orders and does not claim certainty. Its job is to answer whether a setup is actionable, should wait for confirmation, should be avoided, or should be reduced/invalidated.

Core modules:

- `MarketRegimeService`: classifies risk appetite, trend, volatility, breadth and sector rotation from stored public OHLCV.
- `SetupClassifierService`: maps evidence into setup types such as `momentum_breakout`, `pullback_to_trend`, `trend_continuation`, `volatility_squeeze`, `reversal_from_support` or `avoid_no_edge`.
- `EntryExitEngine`: creates informational entry zones, confirmation triggers, invalidation levels, stop logic, target zones, trailing logic and no-trade conditions.
- `RiskEngine`: scores ATR risk, invalidation distance, volatility, liquidity, gap risk, regime risk and risk/reward.
- `ExecutionSimulatorService`: tests historical execution feasibility using persisted point-in-time predictions and outcomes.
- `NoTradeFilter`: rejects setups with poor risk/reward, wide invalidation, hostile regime, weak volume, extended RSI, low reliability or poor data quality.
- `ExitEngine`: monitors stop/invalidation, partial-profit, trailing, momentum-decay, volume-climax and thesis-invalidation exit signals.

The final **Sniper Score** measures actionability, not generic attractiveness. An asset can have a strong Opportunity Score and still receive a low Sniper Score if the entry is late, invalidation is too wide, the regime is hostile or historical expectancy is weak.

Actionability states:

- `avoid`
- `watch`
- `wait_for_trigger`
- `actionable_if_confirmed`
- `active_setup`
- `exit_or_reduce`

- `GET /api/sniper/setups`
- `GET /api/sniper/regimes`
- `GET /api/sniper/metrics`

Frontend:

- `/sniper` shows Market Regime, Top Sniper Candidates, Active Setups, Wait For Trigger, Avoid List, Best Risk/Reward, Setup Reliability, Recent Learning Lessons, Entry/Exit Plans, No-Trade Reasons and Execution Simulation Results.

BLUM Chat can now answer questions such as “È entrabile adesso?”, “Meglio aspettare?”, “Dove si invalida il setup?”, “Dove avrebbe senso prendere profitto?” and “Perché BLUM dice wait invece di active setup?” using conditional, risk-aware language.

Guardrails:

- no guaranteed profit;
- no direct financial advice;
- no active setup without confirmation;
- no entry plan without invalidation;
- no target without risk/reward;
- no real-time claim without timestamp;
- R-multiple expectancy is preferred over raw win rate;
- insufficient samples lower reliability.

## Reproducible Trading Game

The **Reproducible Trading Game** turns Sniper and Learning Loop evidence into paper P/L learning. It starts with a virtual 100 EUR bankroll and evaluates whether BLUM's setups are repeatable, risk-managed and benchmark-aware. It is not an execution bot and it never claims guaranteed market outperformance.

Core modules:

- `TradingKnowledgeBase`: structured rules for market structure, technical analysis, professional setups, risk management, performance metrics and behavioral filters.
- `ReproducibleTradePlanEngine`: converts Sniper candidates into reproducible plans with entry condition, confirmation, invalidation, stop, target, holding period, no-trade conditions and data timestamp.
- `CapitalManagementEngine`: applies fixed-fractional, volatility/reproducibility/drawdown-adjusted sizing. Default risk is 1% and capped at 2%.
- `TradingGameSimulator`: consumes point-in-time execution simulations, applies realistic R-multiple P/L, tracks equity, drawdown, benchmark comparison, failure modes and capital lessons.

The simulator explicitly rejects or penalizes low-reproducibility logic:

- no 10-second scalping;
- no tick-level, latency-arbitrage or HFT assumptions;
- no trade without invalidation;
- no trade without position sizing;
- no full-capital risk;
- no benchmark outperformance claim from a small sample.

New persistence tables:

- `trading_games`
- `trading_game_trades`
- `trading_game_equity_curve`
- `trading_game_failures`
- `capital_management_lessons`

- `TRADING_GAME_DEFAULT_RISK_PERCENT=1`
- `TRADING_GAME_MAX_RISK_PERCENT=2`
- `TRADING_GAME_BENCHMARK=SPY`

The Learning Loop dashboard shows current game capital, equity curve, benchmark equity curve, recent trade decisions, expectancy, profit factor, drawdown, risk of ruin, reproducibility score and capital management lessons.

## Blum Financial Model

Blum now includes the foundation for a proprietary reasoning model called **Blum Financial Model**. This is not another chatbot layer and it does not train automatically inside the Space. It is the infrastructure that preserves, evaluates and exports Blum's accumulated financial reasoning so a future **Blum Analyst** model can be trained from Blum's own thesis history.

The model layer captures every persisted asset thesis into a proprietary knowledge record with:

- market context: timestamp, market regime, volatility regime, sector context, macro placeholders, breadth context and risk sentiment;
- asset context: ticker, sector, industry, price action, volume profile, technical indicators, sentiment indicators and news indicators;
- Blum reasoning: executive thesis, why now, supporting evidence, contradicting evidence, risks, invalidation conditions, narrative analysis, confidence and conviction score;
- prediction horizons: 1D, 3D, 7D, 14D and 30D outcome-evaluation slots;
- thesis quality: reasoning depth, consistency, contradiction handling, confidence calibration, historical alignment, narrative quality and explainability quality;
- self critique: analyst view, skeptic view, historical view and balanced final view;
- training sample: JSON-ready input/output and chat messages for future supervised fine-tuning or preference learning.

New persistence tables include:

- `blum_knowledge_records`
- `blum_thesis_outcomes`
- `blum_reasoning_memory`
- `blum_training_examples`
- `blum_thesis_quality_scores`
- `blum_self_critiques`
- `blum_narrative_memory`
- `blum_regime_memory`

- `benchmark_relative_outcomes`
- `blum_knowledge_graph_nodes`
- `blum_knowledge_graph_edges`
- `blum_dataset_exports`
- `blum_model_training_jobs`

- `GET /model/training/quality`
- `POST /model/training/quality/evaluate`
- `POST /model/training/export/high-quality`

Training export uses JSONL and targets future Hugging Face training workflows for Qwen, Llama or Mistral with LoRA, full fine-tuning, DPO or preference learning. The Space only creates dataset and job-plan records; it does not launch fine-tuning automatically.

The objective is not to predict stock prices. The objective is to learn how Blum reasons: explain, contextualize, compare, critique, calibrate confidence and improve future thesis quality.

The autonomous Blum Financial Model cycle is server-side and evidence-bound. When `BLUM_ENABLE_LEARNING_LOOP=true`, it runs on startup, during market refresh and on its own interval controlled by `BLUM_MODEL_CYCLE_MINUTES` and `BLUM_MODEL_CYCLE_LIMIT`. Each cycle captures recent signal reasoning, evaluates matured thesis outcomes, refreshes training examples and logs a `blum_model_autonomous_cycle` learning event.

The **Reasoning Precision Core** extends this cycle from static score memory to thesis memory:

- every thesis receives a lifecycle status: `ACTIVE`, `STRENGTHENING`, `WEAKENING`, `INVALIDATED`, `COMPLETED` or `EXPIRED`;
- thesis survival measures how long a thesis remains valid, when it weakens, when it expires and whether it beats the relevant benchmark;
- conviction decay updates confidence gradually from fresh evidence, stale evidence, contradictions, price confirmation, sector/regime confirmation and benchmark-relative behavior;
- reliability is measured by engine, signal type, setup type, thesis type, sector, industry, asset class, horizon, market regime, volatility regime and breadth regime;
- thesis competition stores bull, bear and neutral alternatives so BLUM is not forced into one opinion when uncertainty is high;
- ensemble evolution records each internal engine vote, penalizes disagreement and stores reversible weight versions only when sample size is sufficient;
- benchmark-relative intelligence checks whether a thesis beats SPY, QQQ, VTI or sector proxies instead of merely moving with the market;
- training dataset quality gates decide which examples are good enough for future SFT, preference learning or DPO export;
- meta-learning events explain repeated reasoning errors, overconfidence, underconfidence and engine reliability changes.

It updates database memory only; it does not self-modify source code, it does not execute trades and it does not claim guaranteed market outperformance.

## Autonomous Research Engine

Blum now runs a server-side autonomous research cycle by default. Manual refresh buttons are diagnostics; normal operation does not require user input. The default cycle is controlled by:

```bash
export BLUM_ENABLE_AUTONOMOUS_ENGINE=true
export BLUM_AUTONOMOUS_CYCLE_MINUTES=20
export BLUM_AUTONOMOUS_REPAIR_LIMIT=20
```

The autonomous cycle executes in this strict order:

1. Refresh Hugging Face financial dataset catalog.
2. Update macro context.
3. Update SEC companyfacts fundamentals.
4. Repair historical market-memory gaps for missing, short or stale OHLCV assets.
5. Run an incremental price refresh. Deep `max` backfill is used only when the stored memory is not sufficiently hydrated.
6. Ingest public news and sentiment.
7. Generate signal snapshots.
8. Update ETF intelligence.
9. Update IPO radar.
10. Run accuracy audit.
11. Run Blum Financial Model reasoning, outcome learning and Reasoning Precision Core orchestration.
12. Run BLUM Learning Loop point-in-time historical simulation batch.
13. Persist embedded PostgreSQL backup when configured.

Every cycle creates an `autonomous_engine_runs` row and a `learning_events` audit entry. `/pipeline/status` exposes the current stage, completed stages and compact stage diagnostics while the worker is running. Deep historical backfill is processed in batches so startup remains observable and the engine keeps cycling. If a provider fails, the run is marked `degraded` with the failing stage and traceback, rather than hiding the issue.

New APIs:

- `GET /autonomous/status`
- `POST /autonomous/run`
- `GET /datasets/sources`
- `POST /datasets/refresh`

## Hugging Face Dataset Intelligence

Blum catalogs real Hugging Face datasets for historical prices, SEC filings, earnings transcripts, finance reasoning and benchmark evidence. The catalog is metadata-first and incremental by design: large corpora are validated through Dataset Viewer/parquet metadata before any targeted ingestion is attempted.

Initial curated sources include:

- `defeatbeta/yahoo-finance-data`
- `paperswithbacktest/Stocks-Daily-Price`
- `TeraflopAI/SEC-EDGAR`
- `kurry/sp500_earnings_transcripts`
- `glopardo/sp500-earnings-transcripts`
- `paperswithbacktest/Stocks-Quarterly-Earnings`
- `c3po-ai/edgar-corpus`
- `PatronusAI/financebench`
- `BUPT-Reasoning-Lab/FinanceReasoning`
- `jlh-ibm/earnings_call`
- `younginpiniti/us-stocks-daily-all`
- `sfd-anonymous/edgar-forecast-benchmark`

The catalog is stored in `external_dataset_sources` with dataset id, source domain, license, priority, ingestion mode, Dataset Viewer status, parquet metadata and usage policy. Blum does not copy massive datasets blindly and does not fabricate missing evidence.

## Chart Vision Technical Analyst

Blum includes a dedicated technical chart intelligence module. It is designed to read financial chart images when a vision model is configured, but it never relies only on visual interpretation.

The module combines:

- **Qwen3-VL** as the primary configurable vision-language model for chart screenshots.
- **InternVL3** as a fallback model for low-confidence or failed visual interpretation.
- A deterministic OHLCV technical analysis engine for objective indicator and level calculation.
- Blum Financial Brain memory for historical context and similarity.
- Existing sentiment/news context for confirmation or contradiction checks.

The deterministic engine calculates:

- trend direction;
- higher highs, higher lows, lower highs and lower lows;
- support and resistance zones;
- EMA 9/21/50/200 and SMA 20/50/200;
- RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands and ATR;
- relative volume and volume pressure;
- volatility regime and compression;
- gaps, consolidation zones and pullback quality;
- accumulation/distribution bias;
- price/RSI and price/MACD divergences;
- breakout probability;
- trend strength;
- risk/reward geometry.

The hybrid layer outputs trend summary, key levels, bullish/bearish/neutral evidence, confirmation signals, contradiction signals, invalidation level, risk zone, opportunity zone, confidence, scenarios, what to watch next and historical chart similarity.

Model serving is configurable:

```bash
export CHART_VISION_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-VL
export CHART_VISION_FALLBACK_MODEL=OpenGVLab/InternVL3
export CHART_VISION_MODE=disabled   # local | remote | disabled
export CHART_VISION_MIN_CONFIDENCE=0.70
export CHART_VISION_REMOTE_URL=
export CHART_VISION_REMOTE_TOKEN=
```

Default Docker demo behavior is `CHART_VISION_MODE=disabled`, so the app remains reliable on CPU Spaces. The UI displays: `Vision model unavailable, deterministic analysis active`. Use `remote` mode for a production VLM endpoint.

## Market Brain

The Market Brain is Blum's high-level reasoning orchestrator. It is not a single model that invents an answer. It combines:

- latest stock signal snapshots;
- ETF rotation and thematic confirmation;
- market-wide FinBERT/VADER sentiment records;
- live public news intensity;
- stored OHLCV-derived trend and risk metrics;
- SEC IPO/pre-listing filing evidence;
- explicit evidence gaps and source diagnostics.

The output includes current regime, forward scenarios, opportunity stack, risk alerts, model stack and an evidence ledger. It is a research-priority engine, not a recommendation system.

The Brain also persists snapshot history and compares each run with the previous one. The change log highlights regime changes, score movement, top stock/ETF/IPO leader changes and risk-count shifts. A contradiction engine flags price/sentiment conflicts, overbought high-risk setups and market-wide narrative conflicts. An event graph links themes, stocks, ETFs, IPO candidates and live news into a compact intelligence map.

### Blum Financial Brain

Blum includes a dedicated financial-domain AI brain adapter. The default configured open model is `AdaptLLM/finance-chat`, a finance-domain chat model. It is opt-in through `BLUM_ENABLE_FINANCIAL_BRAIN_MODEL=true` because 7B finance models can exceed free CPU Space resources. When the model is disabled or cannot load, Blum serves the same JSON contract through a deterministic evidence engine, clearly labeled as fallback.

The Financial Brain produces market thesis, regime interpretation, opportunity hypotheses, risk hypotheses, contradictions to resolve, monitoring plan, confidence and limitations. It receives only the Market Brain evidence packet and is instructed not to invent prices, target prices, listing dates, valuations, forecasts or recommendations.

## IPO And Pre-Listing Intelligence

IPO Radar scans SEC EDGAR current filing feeds for `S-1`, `S-1/A`, `F-1`, `F-1/A`, `424B1` and `424B4` forms. It also surfaces stored public news narratives that mention IPOs, listings, prospectuses, market debuts and SPACs.

For deeper issuer history, the backend can query the official SEC company submissions API at `data.sec.gov`. The IPO Radar UI exposes SEC filing history and can persist additional IPO-related filings into PostgreSQL.

The IPO score separates:

- readiness score;
- listing probability proxy;
- narrative heat;
- filing quality;
- valuation or risk-term pressure;
- final opportunity score.

No listing date, valuation, ticker or private-company claim is fabricated. Empty radar sections mean no public evidence has been stored yet.

## Signal Methodology

The signal engine combines:

- momentum: 1D, 5D, 1M, 3M, 6M, YTD and relative strength;
- trend quality: SMA/EMA structure, slopes, ADX, persistence and drawdown;
- volatility and risk: historical volatility, ATR, beta, downside volatility, gaps and volume spikes;
- technical indicators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, support and resistance;
- news and sentiment: FinBERT sentiment, VADER baseline, 7D/30D sentiment trend and news intensity;
- semantic themes: recurring narratives such as AI, rates, earnings, guidance, geopolitics, M&A, regulation, supply chain and innovation;
- ETF intelligence: ETF momentum, thematic confirmation and rotation;
- anomaly detection: price, volume, news and narrative divergences.

The final score is called the **Blum Intelligence Score**. It produces explainable classifications:

- Strong Watch
- Watch
- Neutral
- Avoid / Too Risky
- Contrarian Setup
- Narrative Breakout
- Technical Breakout
- Sentiment Divergence

`GET /ai/explain/{ticker}` is auto-hydrating: if no signal snapshot exists yet, the backend attempts on-demand real public price hydration, ticker-specific news ingestion and signal generation before returning an explanation. If verified data is still insufficient, it returns an `Insufficient Evidence` explanation with provider diagnostics instead of fabricating a signal.

The UI is intentionally dense, dark and technical: Bloomberg-style information density, Linear/Vercel-style cleanliness, TradingView-style chart clarity and OpenBB-style open-source posture.

Signal surfaces include score version, confidence score and lifecycle state (`new`, `confirmed`, `strengthening`, `active`, `faded`, `invalidated`) so the platform can show whether a signal is emerging, durable or deteriorating.

## Trading Game Transparency

BLUM now treats the Reproducible Trading Game as an auditable evidence system, not a black-box P/L counter. Every simulated paper trade can be traced through:

- Trade Ledger: ticker, setup, entry, exit, position size, stop/invalidation, targets, P/L, R-multiple, benchmark excess and outcome label.
- Trade Replay: entry decision, exit decision, thesis link, risk plan, same-period benchmark comparison and learning outcome.
- Trade Attribution: Technical Engine, Sniper Engine, Regime Engine, Learning Loop, Capital Manager and Benchmark Evaluator contributions.
- Trade Quality Score: process-quality scoring separated from raw P/L, so lucky profitable trades can be penalized and rule-following losses can still be useful evidence.
- Annotated Equity Curve: entry/exit, wins, losses, stop hits, missed entries, bankruptcy and other learning events are attached to the capital curve.
- Learning Evidence Log: each trade can create structured observations for setup confirmation, setup failure, entry timing, exit logic, no-trade filters and benchmark-relative learning.
- Reality Check: sample size, profit concentration, sector/regime coverage, fractional-share simplification, slippage/spread assumptions and possible overfitting warnings.
- P/L Breakdown: total and per-trade P/L, fees/slippage/spread estimates, P/L by setup, ticker, sector, regime, engine contribution and holding-period bucket.

Simulated P/L is research evidence only. Strong numbers are not considered robust until sample size, regime coverage, benchmark fairness and execution realism pass the reality checks. BLUM does not claim guaranteed profit or provide financial advice.

## Trading Intelligence Lab

BLUM now extends the Learning Loop and Reproducible Trading Game into a measurable Trading Intelligence Lab. The goal is not to show an impressive capital number in isolation; the goal is to make every simulated decision auditable and to measure whether BLUM is becoming better at selecting setups, timing entries, managing exits, controlling risk and comparing results against benchmarks.

Core additions:

- Advanced Trade Ledger: filterable ledger analytics by trade, ticker, setup, outcome, market regime, benchmark, R-multiple, P/L, trade quality, reproducibility score and capital cycle.
- Capital Cycles: each paper cycle starts at 100 EUR and targets 10,000 EUR by default. When the target is reached, the cycle is closed, counted and a new 100 EUR cycle starts. When capital reaches zero, the bankruptcy cycle is closed, counted and restarted.
- Cycle Metrics: target cycles completed, bankrupt cycles, active cycle progress, average days to target, average days to bankruptcy, target hit rate, survival rate, best cycle and worst cycle.
- Outcome Metrics: win rate, loss rate, missed-entry rate, target-hit rate, stop-hit rate, invalidation hits, no-trade correct rate, no-trade missed-opportunity rate, average R, median R, expectancy R and profit factor.
- Decision Quality Metrics: entry timing, exit timing, sizing quality, risk/reward quality, benchmark-relative quality, reproducibility quality, process quality and trade quality.
- Intelligence Growth Metrics: rolling 30/100-trade measurements, improvement by setup, regime and sector, repeated-mistake reduction and benchmark-relative progress.
- Live Forward Paper Mode: current-market decisions are timestamp-frozen, tracked as paper-only positions and evaluated only after future market refreshes. It uses the same risk management, ledger, benchmark comparison and quality evaluation as historical simulation.
- Historical vs Live Comparison: historical simulation is useful backtest-like evidence, while live forward paper trading is stronger evidence once enough timestamp-frozen trades close. The UI shows both with sample-size warnings.
- Statistical Reality Warnings: panels warn on too few trades, too few live trades, too few tickers, too few regimes, profit concentration, historical-only evidence, unrealistic capital growth, high profit factor with low sample size, missing slippage/spread context and benchmark gaps.
- Chat Integration: BLUM Chat can answer questions about the best/worst cycle, 100 EUR to 10,000 EUR completions, bankrupt cycles, missed entries, stop hits, target hits, live-vs-historical results and whether the evidence is statistically reliable. It must use actual ledger and metrics data; if data is missing it must say so.

Important constraints:

- Historical simulation is not enough to prove edge.
- Live forward paper trading is stronger evidence, but only after enough closed trades.
- Capital cycles prevent infinite, unrealistic equity growth from hiding risk.
- Every trade remains paper research with entry, exit, thesis, outcome, benchmark comparison, attribution, quality score and learning evidence.
- Every performance number must be read with sample-size and realism context.
- BLUM does not execute real trades, does not provide financial advice and does not claim guaranteed outperformance.

## Learning Intelligence Benchmark Dashboard

BLUM now adds a Learning Intelligence Control Room on top of the Trading Intelligence Lab. This release is deliberately truth-first: BLUM does not assume it is good, does not hide benchmark underperformance and does not treat historical simulation as proof of alpha.

The dashboard measures whether BLUM is becoming a better trading-reasoning system through:

- Trading Power Score: a strict 0-100 composite score with classification from `Not usable` to `Exceptional, requires external validation`. It combines benchmark-relative evidence, expectancy, drawdown control, win/loss quality, missed-entry penalty, risk management, capital-cycle behavior, live paper validation, regime robustness, setup diversity, statistical confidence, reproducibility, decision quality and learning velocity.
- Official Benchmark Comparison: BLUM is compared against SPY, QQQ, VTI, DIA, IWM, sector ETFs and simple practical baselines such as cash/no-trade, random-selection proxy, random-entry/random-exit proxy, momentum proxy, moving-average proxy and sector-rotation proxy.
- Learning Progress: rolling 30/100/250-action views for win rate, expectancy, benchmark excess, missed entries, stop hits, target hits and overall intelligence growth.
- Strength and Weakness Map: setup, regime, sector and engine-level weakness detection, including high missed-entry rate, excessive stop hits, benchmark underperformance, low sample size and weak evidence coverage.
- Self-Improvement Action Engine: measured weaknesses are converted into auditable improvement proposals such as increasing Learning Loop sampling, testing pullback-retest entries, penalizing late breakout entries or comparing against passive benchmarks before confidence increases.
- Live vs Historical Validation: historical results are marked as backtest-like evidence; live forward paper results are treated as stronger evidence only when enough timestamp-frozen trades close.
- Truth Panel: a short, blunt explanation of whether BLUM is currently outperforming or underperforming relevant benchmarks, whether the sample is reliable and what the system should study next.

Important safeguards:

- Every performance claim is benchmarked, sample-size aware and statistically cautious.
- If BLUM underperforms SPY, QQQ, VTI or a simple baseline, the dashboard says so.
- If live forward evidence is immature, the dashboard says `not reliable yet`.
- Self-improvement actions are logged, reversible and do not modify source code.
- Low-risk actions can be queued for testing, but risky changes require review.
- BLUM does not claim guaranteed outperformance, does not provide financial advice and does not execute real trades.

## Local Setup

```bash
cd hf-blum-mvp
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm --prefix frontend install
npm --prefix frontend run build
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/blum
PYTHONPATH=backend uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7860
```

Optional full Financial Brain model loading:

```bash
export BLUM_ENABLE_FINANCIAL_BRAIN_MODEL=true
export BLUM_FINANCIAL_BRAIN_MODEL=AdaptLLM/finance-chat
```

Keep this disabled on constrained CPU demos unless enough memory is available. The deterministic Financial Brain fallback remains evidence-bound and transparent.

The learning loops only update database memory, confidence adjustments, proprietary reasoning examples and reversible scoring-weight versions.

## Decision Superiority, Business Quality and Portfolio Intelligence

This release upgrades BLUM from trade-outcome analysis to decision-quality analysis.

The core question is no longer only:

> Did this trade work?

The new question is:

> Was this the best available decision at that moment, considering alternative opportunities, business quality, portfolio context and benchmark alternatives?

### Decision Superiority Engine

`DecisionSuperiorityEngine` evaluates every comparable BLUM decision against the opportunity set available in the same decision window.

It measures:

- Opportunity Recall: how many future outperformers BLUM identified before they outperformed.
- Opportunity Precision: how many selected opportunities became outperformers.
- Alpha Capture Rate: how much available alpha BLUM captured versus what was available.
- Ranking Accuracy: whether BLUM ranked the best future performers near the top.
- Missed Opportunities: candidates BLUM ignored that later performed better.
- Best Decisions and Worst Decisions: auditable evidence, not narrative claims.

Main API:

- `GET /api/decision-intelligence/dashboard`
- `GET /api/decision-intelligence/superiority`
- `POST /api/decision-intelligence/superiority/recalculate`
- `GET /api/decision-intelligence/universe-snapshots`
- `POST /api/decision-intelligence/universe-snapshots/recalculate`
- `GET /api/decision-intelligence/missed-opportunities`

### Business Quality Engine

`BusinessQualityEngine` scores company quality from stored fundamental evidence. If fundamentals are missing, BLUM explicitly marks the company as `insufficient_fundamental_evidence` and penalizes the score.

It evaluates:

- growth quality;
- profitability quality;
- cash-flow quality;
- balance-sheet quality;
- capital-allocation quality;
- moat quality;
- management-quality proxies;
- fundamental alpha patterns from historical outcomes.

Main API:

- `GET /api/business-quality/dashboard`
- `GET /api/business-quality/scores`
- `POST /api/business-quality/recalculate`

### Portfolio Intelligence Engine

`PortfolioIntelligenceEngine` measures whether a position improves the simulated portfolio, not only whether the position made money.

It evaluates:

- return contribution;
- risk contribution;
- drawdown contribution;
- alpha contribution;
- portfolio concentration;
- correlation between positions;
- position-sizing outcomes;
- portfolio quality score.

Main API:

- `GET /api/portfolio-intelligence/dashboard`
- `GET /api/portfolio-intelligence/quality`
- `POST /api/portfolio-intelligence/recalculate`

### Adaptive Capital Allocation Intelligence

`AdaptiveCapitalAllocationEngine` upgrades BLUM from trade evaluation to capital allocation research. It does not create trades and does not rewrite the Trading Game. It studies the evidence already produced by Trading Game, Decision Superiority, Business Quality and Portfolio Intelligence to answer:

- how much simulated capital each opportunity deserved;
- when capital should stay in cash;
- whether capital was underallocated to winners or overallocated to losers;
- which sizing logic produced better risk-adjusted alpha;
- how positions interact through correlation, sector concentration and combined exposure;
- whether the portfolio could have been allocated better than it was.

The layer persists an auditable history in:

- `capital_allocation_snapshots`
- `opportunity_capital_scores`
- `cash_allocation_decisions`
- `allocation_efficiency_audits`
- `sizing_logic_allocations`
- `capital_interaction_risks`

Main API:

- `GET /api/capital-allocation/dashboard`
- `GET /api/capital-allocation/plan`
- `GET /api/capital-allocation/opportunities`
- `GET /api/capital-allocation/cash-policy`
- `GET /api/capital-allocation/efficiency`
- `GET /api/capital-allocation/sizing`
- `GET /api/capital-allocation/interactions`
- `POST /api/capital-allocation/recalculate`

The engine treats cash as an active research decision. Cash reserve rises when sample size is weak, expectancy is negative, benchmark excess is poor, drawdown is elevated or stop-hit rates are high. Capital weights are capped when evidence is thin, drawdown is high or position interaction risk is elevated.

### Alpha Loss & Recovery Engine

`Alpha Loss & Recovery Engine` upgrades BLUM from measuring underperformance to explaining why alpha was lost and what should be tested next. It is evidence-bound and snapshot-safe: dashboards read stored rows or `alpha_recovery_summary`; heavy attribution runs only through explicit backend recalculation or scheduled jobs.

It adds:

- `BenchmarkMethodologyValidator`: blocks learning from invalid benchmark comparisons, including missing periods, inconsistent horizons, weak sample size, return mismatches and proxy-only baselines.
- `AlphaLossAttributionEngine`: decomposes validated benchmark underperformance into measurable causes such as missed entry, wrong asset selection, premature exit, poor exit, excessive cash and weak capital allocation.
- `MissedWinnersEngine`: stores assets BLUM ignored or underweighted that later outperformed, including rank, rejection reason, confidence, blocked rule and suggested learning action.
- `AlphaRecoveryActionEngine`: converts repeated alpha-loss evidence into reversible recovery experiments such as pullback-retest replay, ranking threshold tests, allocation replay and exit-logic audits.
- `alpha_loss_replay`: a Learning Loop trigger that prioritizes missed winners and rejected outperformers while preserving the existing point-in-time and anti-overfitting guardrails.
- Truth Layer: exposes when evidence is insufficient, benchmark methodology is invalid, performance is not statistically reliable or recovery conclusions are not yet justified.

Persisted evidence:

- `benchmark_methodology_validations`
- `alpha_loss_attributions`
- `missed_winners`
- `alpha_recovery_actions`
- dashboard snapshot type `alpha_recovery_summary`

Main API:

- `GET /api/alpha-recovery/dashboard`
- `POST /api/alpha-recovery/recalculate`
- `GET /api/alpha-recovery/methodology`
- `POST /api/alpha-recovery/methodology/validate`
- `GET /api/alpha-recovery/attribution`
- `POST /api/alpha-recovery/attribution/calculate`
- `GET /api/alpha-recovery/missed-winners`
- `POST /api/alpha-recovery/missed-winners/detect`
- `GET /api/alpha-recovery/actions`
- `POST /api/alpha-recovery/actions/generate`
- `GET /api/alpha-recovery/replay-priorities`

What it does:

- explains benchmark-relative alpha loss using stored trade, benchmark, allocation and decision evidence;
- identifies missed or rejected winners for targeted replay;
- generates testable recovery actions with expected impact, affected module, prior metric and rollback capability;
- routes alpha-loss evidence back into Learning Loop sampling;
- gives BLUM Chat evidence for questions such as why BLUM is losing against SPY/QQQ or which opportunities were missed.

What it does not do:

- it does not claim BLUM found alpha;
- it does not guarantee recovery or benchmark outperformance;
- it does not fabricate missed winners without stored future outcome evidence;
- it does not learn from invalid benchmark methodology;
- it does not self-modify source code or apply irreversible rule changes.

### Meta-Cognition Engine

`Meta-Cognition Engine` teaches BLUM how to evaluate its own reasoning process. It does not ask only whether a trade worked; it asks which reasoning factor created value, which factor destroyed value, which factor was noisy and where the Learning Loop should focus next.

It adds:

- `LearningImportanceEngine`: measures factor-level contribution across technicals, momentum, volume, sentiment, narrative, fundamentals, business quality, regime, decision superiority, sniper score, entry/exit timing, no-trade filters, capital allocation, position sizing, portfolio interaction, alpha recovery and confidence calibration.
- `CapitalPreservationAlphaEngine`: measures value created by not acting, separating avoided losses from missed gains and scoring no-trade quality.
- `MetaCognitionEngine`: evaluates whether learning events, recovery actions and rule experiments improved future metrics or degraded them.
- `LearningFocusOptimizer`: converts factor importance, alpha-loss evidence, missed winners, failed actions and no-trade mistakes into active Learning Loop sampling priorities.
- `ReasoningNoiseDetector`: flags weak evidence, tiny-sample effects, overvalued factors, unstable factor contribution and false-confidence risk.

Persisted evidence:

- `learning_factor_importance`
- `meta_cognition_events`
- `capital_preservation_alpha`
- `learning_focus_priorities`
- `reasoning_noise_flags`
- dashboard snapshot type `meta_cognition_summary`

Main API:

- `GET /api/meta-cognition/summary`
- `GET /api/meta-cognition/factor-importance`
- `POST /api/meta-cognition/factor-importance/recalculate`
- `GET /api/meta-cognition/events`
- `POST /api/meta-cognition/evaluate`
- `GET /api/meta-cognition/capital-preservation`
- `POST /api/meta-cognition/capital-preservation/evaluate`
- `GET /api/meta-cognition/learning-focus`
- `POST /api/meta-cognition/learning-focus/generate`
- `GET /api/meta-cognition/noise`
- `POST /api/meta-cognition/noise/detect`
- `POST /api/meta-cognition/recalculate`

Learning Loop integration remains blended and anti-overfit:

- 40% broad random coverage;
- 30% alpha-loss replay;
- 20% factor-importance focus;
- 10% no-trade / capital-preservation replay.

The ratios are configurable through `LEARNING_RANDOM_SAMPLE_RATIO`, `LEARNING_ALPHA_LOSS_SAMPLE_RATIO`, `LEARNING_FACTOR_FOCUS_SAMPLE_RATIO` and `LEARNING_CAPITAL_PRESERVATION_SAMPLE_RATIO`.

Frontend integration is snapshot-first. The Learning Overview shows a lightweight `What BLUM Should Learn Next` panel from `GET /api/learning-intelligence/summary`. Full factor tables, capital preservation evidence, focus priorities, noise flags and meta-cognition events are loaded only inside Deep Diagnostics through an explicit `Load panel` action.

BLUM Chat can answer questions such as:

- which factor is creating or destroying alpha;
- which module is noisy;
- what BLUM should study next;
- which no-trade rule preserved the most capital;
- whether learning actions improved or degraded outcomes.

What it does not do:

- it does not self-modify source code;
- it does not apply risky factor-weight changes automatically;
- it does not claim a factor creates alpha without benchmark-relative evidence;
- it does not optimize from invalid benchmark methodology;
- it does not hide insufficient sample size, noise or overfitting risk.

### Guardrails

- No decision-superiority claim is valid with insufficient comparable samples.
- BLUM must say when a better opportunity existed.
- Business quality is not inferred as fact when fundamentals are missing.
- Portfolio quality is penalized when P/L is concentrated in too few positions.
- Capital allocation must remain evidence-bound: no opportunity receives larger simulated capital without sample-size, benchmark, sizing and interaction context.
- Cash allocation is valid output when the evidence does not justify deployment.
- Allocation efficiency is ex-post research evidence, not a future promise.
- Alpha recovery actions must remain reversible and must not be treated as proof of future alpha.
- Chat responses use stored dashboard evidence only. If the evidence is missing, BLUM must answer `Insufficient evidence`.

## BLUM v1.0 Runtime Architecture

BLUM v1.0 separates financial reasoning from runtime orchestration. The goal is to keep the backend autonomous and measurable while the frontend remains light and snapshot-driven.

The detailed runtime dependency graph, worker architecture, event flow, knowledge flow, snapshot flow and migration notes are maintained in `RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### Central Brain Runtime

`CentralBrainRuntime` is a read-only operational view. It does not score assets, train models or run financial computation. It composes:

- latest module events;
- stale and failed modules;
- missing or stale dashboard snapshots;
- background job state;
- learning health;
- current measured bottleneck from performance diagnostics;
- system readiness.

Endpoint:

- `GET /brain/runtime-state`

### Independent Worker Runtime

`RuntimeWorkerCoordinator` turns the APScheduler runtime into named, independently observable workers. It does not replace APScheduler and it does not compute financial logic. Its job is to prevent duplicate runs of the same worker while allowing unrelated workers to proceed independently.

Before this extraction, one process-wide `running` flag could defer every scheduled task behind any long-running job. The runtime now blocks only duplicate executions of the same worker and exposes:

- `running_jobs`;
- `running_count`;
- `worker_registry`;
- per-worker queue name;
- per-worker max item/time budgets;
- duplicate-worker deferrals as `module_deferred` events.

Core registered workers:

- `runtime_snapshot_watchdog`
- `snapshot_producer`
- `autonomous_research_engine`
- `news_refresh`
- `market_refresh`
- `data_gap_repair`
- `accuracy_audit`
- `macro_refresh`
- `fundamentals_refresh`
- `ipo_refresh`
- `financial_brain_learning`
- `blum_financial_model_cycle`
- `blum_point_in_time_learning_loop`
- `blum_trading_game`
- `blum_professional_learning_cycle`

This keeps the Central Brain as an orchestrator/observer. Learning, Trading Game, Market Data, Snapshot Producer and research workers remain owners of their own state and evidence.

### Event Bus

`BrainEventBus` persists module lifecycle events in `brain_runtime_events`.

Event examples:

- `module_started`
- `module_completed`
- `module_failed`
- `learning_cycle_completed`
- `trading_game_updated`
- `benchmark_updated`
- `alpha_recovery_updated`
- `meta_cognition_updated`
- `capital_allocation_updated`
- `snapshot_requested`
- `snapshot_refreshed`
- `snapshot_failed`
- `module_deferred`
- `worker_recovered`

Events are evidence for observability, not triggers for hidden trading or hidden model changes.

### Background Job State

`BackgroundJobStateService` stores resumable job state in `background_job_state`.

Tracked fields include:

- job and stage name;
- status;
- cursor;
- items processed;
- item budget;
- duration;
- last start/completion;
- next run timestamp;
- error message;
- enabled flag.

Default runtime budgets:

- `BLUM_AUTONOMOUS_MAX_SECONDS_PER_JOB=120`
- `BLUM_AUTONOMOUS_MAX_ITEMS_PER_JOB=50`
- `BLUM_MARKET_REFRESH_MAX_ITEMS_PER_JOB=10`
- `BLUM_MARKET_PROVIDER_VALIDATION_MAX_ITEMS=2`

These budgets make long jobs visible and constrain new runtime work. Existing financial engines are not rewritten by this layer.

On process startup, stale `running` rows left by a previous container are marked `interrupted`, and previous-process `failed` rows are archived as `previous_failed`. This prevents a restarted Space from reporting dead workers or old failures as current-process health failures while keeping the audit trail in `brain_runtime_events`.

### Snapshot Producer

`SnapshotProducerService` writes UI-ready snapshots from stored evidence only. It does not trigger benchmark recalculation, training, Learning Loop runs or Trading Game runs.

Tracked snapshot types:

- `learning_summary`
- `trading_game_summary`
- `benchmark_summary`
- `intelligence_growth_summary`
- `truth_panel_summary`
- `decision_intelligence_summary`
- `business_quality_summary`
- `portfolio_intelligence_summary`
- `capital_allocation_summary`
- `alpha_recovery_summary`
- `meta_cognition_summary`
- `dashboard_overview_summary`
- `trading_game_ledger_snapshot`
- `equity_curve_snapshot`

Snapshots support:

- partial payloads;
- timestamps;
- stale state;
- warnings;
- `missing_sections_json`;
- fast read paths.

Endpoint:

- `POST /snapshots/produce`

This endpoint is explicit and should not be called by page render.

The lightweight startup batch prioritizes first-screen readiness. `learning_summary` and `dashboard_overview_summary` are generated first, then the same background warm-up continues through every critical snapshot type, including Trading Game ledger/equity snapshots and deeper intelligence summaries. This keeps the API/UI responsive while preventing the Central Brain Runtime from staying degraded after deploy because critical snapshots were never produced.

### Snapshot Watchdog

`SnapshotWatchdogService` checks missing snapshots, stale snapshots, failed producers and long-running jobs.

Endpoint:

- `GET /snapshots/health`

The `GET` endpoint is read-only. Background workers can request lightweight snapshot rebuilds without blocking page render.

### Startup Light Mode

Startup now separates API readiness from heavy research.

Configuration:

- `BLUM_STARTUP_RUN_FULL_AUTONOMOUS=false`
- `BLUM_ENABLE_LIVE_STARTUP=true`

With the default configuration, startup warms runtime snapshots and scheduler state instead of running the full autonomous engine immediately. Heavy work remains scheduled/background-first.

Historical OHLCV startup seeding is resilient. If the packaged cache is missing, unresolved as a Git LFS pointer or not a valid gzip payload, BLUM reports `missing`, `git_lfs_pointer` or `invalid`, creates no synthetic prices and continues booting so live/background hydration can repair the data gap.

### Read-Only Frontend Rule

The Learning page remains:

1. Overview
2. Trading Game
3. Deep Diagnostics

Overview calls only:

- `GET /api/learning-intelligence/summary`

Deep runtime diagnostics are lazy-loaded through explicit buttons:

- Central Brain Runtime;
- Snapshot Watchdog;
- Learning Health;
- Performance Diagnostics;
- Deep model panels.

The frontend request wrapper blocks heavy Learning-page POST calls during initial render and treats `/snapshots/produce` as heavy.

### GET Endpoint Hygiene

GET endpoints must not write data. The runtime now records a warning when a `GET` request contains `persist=true`:

- event: `GET_ENDPOINT_SIDE_EFFECT_DETECTED`
- header: `X-BLUM-GET-SIDE-EFFECT-RISK: true`

This preserves backward compatibility while making side-effect risk visible.

### Learning Health

Endpoint:

- `GET /learning/health`

Returns:

- `healthy`, `degraded`, `stale` or `failed`;
- worker alive state;
- current job and stage;
- last successful learning cycle;
- last successful trading game cycle;
- last successful alpha recovery cycle;
- last successful meta-cognition cycle;
- learning events in the last 24 hours;
- errors in the last 24 hours;
- missing snapshots;
- stale modules.

### Performance Targets

Targets for future measurement:

- `/api/learning-intelligence/summary` p95 under 300ms;
- `/dashboard/overview` p95 under 500ms;
- `/api/trading-game/ledger?limit=25` p95 under 800ms;
- no default background job over 120 seconds;
- cache hit rate over 50%;
- Learning Overview max 2 initial requests;
- no heavy POST during page load;
- no missing critical snapshots after warm-up.

Do not claim these targets are met unless `/performance/diagnostics` confirms them in the running environment.

## Docker

```bash
cd hf-blum-mvp
docker build -t blum-ai-financial-intelligence .
docker run --rm -p 7860:7860 blum-ai-financial-intelligence
```

If `DATABASE_URL` is not set, the Docker demo starts an embedded PostgreSQL instance inside the container. For production-like use, provide an external PostgreSQL database:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 7860:7860 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host:5432/blum \
  blum-ai-financial-intelligence
```

For Hugging Face Docker demos without an external database, the startup script writes periodic embedded PostgreSQL backups to `/data/blum/embedded_postgres_blum.sql` and restores them on startup when the public schema is empty. This protects the learning memory only when Hugging Face persistent storage is enabled for the `/data` mount. The strict no-reset configuration is still an external `DATABASE_URL`.

## Hugging Face Spaces Deployment

Use a Docker Space. Upload the repository with:

- `Dockerfile`
- `requirements.txt`
- `backend/`
- `frontend/`
- `scripts/`
- `package.json`
- `README.md`

## Deployment Visibility

The UI exposes `/system/status` in the sidebar and dashboard. If the GUI looks unchanged after an upload, check:

- `app_version` must show the latest deployed version.
- `feature_set` must show the expected feature bundle.
- `persistence.mode` must be `external_postgres` for strict no-reset durability, or `embedded_postgres` with a populated backup file plus persistent `/data` storage for demo durability.
- `GET /autonomous/status` shows the latest autonomous run, stage diagnostics, readiness score and dataset catalog status.
- `POST /system/persistence/backup` exists as an administrative recovery endpoint; normal operation persists through the autonomous worker.
- `Financial Brain` shows `fallback mode` unless `BLUM_ENABLE_FINANCIAL_BRAIN_MODEL=true`.
- Hugging Face serves the previous Docker image until the new build finishes successfully.
- Existing Market Brain snapshots are refreshed by the autonomous worker after deployment.
- Hard-refresh the browser if old static Next.js chunks are cached.

The Space serves the FastAPI backend and the exported Next.js frontend on port `7860`.

## Backtesting and Validation

Backtesting is included for research validation only. It reports historical hit rate, average forward return over 5D/20D/60D, max adverse excursion, max favorable excursion and false positives. It does not predict or guarantee future returns.

## BLUM v1.0.0 Alpha Operating System

`v1.0.0 | alpha-operating-system` turns BLUM's existing learning, trading, benchmark and meta-cognition layers into a clearer operating layer:

- `GET /brain/command-summary` returns the compact Command Center brain state.
- `GET /brain/capabilities` exposes capability rows for trading, decision, business, portfolio, alpha and paper-copy readiness.
- `GET /brain/evolution` reads stored Trading Power snapshots.
- `GET /trading-game/readiness` explains why Trading Game evidence is ready, building, stale, insufficient, failed or data-quality blocked.
- `GET /alpha/readiness`, `GET /alpha/edge-map` and `GET /alpha/gates` expose strict alpha-readiness evidence without running recalculation.
- `GET /paper-copy/summary`, `GET /paper-copy/strategies`, `GET /paper-copy/positions`, `GET /paper-copy/readiness` and `GET /paper-copy/portfolio/{id}` expose paper-only copy intelligence state.

The release preserves the snapshot-first runtime architecture: Command, Learning and Copy surfaces read lightweight stored evidence and do not trigger training, recalculation, broker activity or heavy Trading Game rebuilds during render.

## Trading Game Readiness

The Learning page now asks `GET /api/trading-game/readiness` before loading equity, ledger and benchmark details. The UI must never remain in generic loading. It shows one of:

- `READY`
- `BUILDING`
- `WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_DATA`
- `STALE_BUT_USABLE`
- `FAILED`
- `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE`
- `DATA_QUALITY_BLOCKED`

Readiness includes source decision counts, source trade counts, eligible trade counts, ledger/equity/benchmark snapshot status, worker status, blocker, next required action, evidence grade and methodology version. It is diagnostic evidence, not a trading signal.

## Command Brain Level

The Command Center includes a lightweight `BLUM Brain Level` panel powered primarily by `GET /brain/command-summary`. It is snapshot-first and shows:

- current learning status and latest run timestamp;
- Trading Power / evidence classification when precomputed;
- Trading Game capital progress, win rate and expectancy R;
- benchmark pressure versus stored market benchmarks;
- latest weakness, latest lesson and next learning focus;
- alpha readiness and paper-copy readiness.

This panel does not run training, recalculation or heavy diagnostics. It is intended to answer quickly whether BLUM's learning evidence is improving, deteriorating or still insufficient.

## Paper Copy Trading Intelligence

`/copy-trading` is a paper-only intelligence surface for conditional mirror plans. The backend keeps the original compatibility endpoints:

- `GET /api/copy-trading/status`
- `GET /api/copy-trading/candidates`
- `GET /api/copy-trading/dashboard`

and adds the v1.0 paper-copy operating endpoints:

- `GET /paper-copy/summary`
- `GET /paper-copy/readiness`
- `GET /paper-copy/strategies`
- `GET /paper-copy/positions`
- `GET /paper-copy/portfolio/{portfolio_id}`

The service reads persisted `TradePlan`, `SniperScore` and Trading Game evidence. It does not recalculate signals, connect to brokers, place orders or claim performance. A candidate is downgraded when it is missing entry trigger, invalidation or target/risk-plan evidence.

The output is designed to answer:

- which setups are theoretically mirrorable only if confirmation triggers;
- which setups should remain watch-only;
- which setups are blocked by risk-plan gaps or weak actionability;
- what BLUM has learned from recent paper trades tied to the same ticker.

Paper Copy Trading Intelligence is a decision-audit layer and paper portfolio research surface, not an execution system. It never connects to a broker and never emits direct financial advice.

## Hyperbolic Multi-Timeframe Replay Engine

BLUM trains on persisted market history through a bounded, background-first replay pipeline. The replay engine checks the local `ReplayMarketBar` store first, imports compatible daily rows from `PriceHistory`, and then uses free Yahoo Chart, yfinance, Stooq and Nasdaq adapters only for missing coverage. Provider failures, unsupported timeframes, partial history and low-quality data are recorded as blockers; missing bars are never synthesized.

Replay decisions are chronological. Features and multi-timeframe context contain only bars closed at or before the decision timestamp, while entry uses a later executable bar. Supported evidence paths include daily swing, pullback, mean-reversion, intraday trend and 1-minute breakout execution when the required `1d`, `15m`, `5m` and `1m` data actually exist. If a lower timeframe is unavailable, BLUM degrades to a compatible setup instead of claiming false precision.

Execution applies market-, asset- and liquidity-sensitive spread, slippage, commission and gap assumptions. Position size is capped by stop distance, ATR, liquidity, confidence, edge, data quality and regime alignment. Replay outcomes update `StrategyMemory`, `SignalPerformance`, `LearningEvent`, `LearningFocusPriority` and `FeedbackLoopAudit` idempotently under the immutable `REPLAY_EVIDENCE` label.

Operational boundaries:

- `POST /api/training/run-replay` runs one explicit, time- and item-bounded replay slice.
- `GET /api/training/snapshot` only reads the latest stored snapshot and never starts training.
- The scheduler runs `hyperbolic_replay_training` independently and persists its asset cursor in `background_job_state`.
- Runtime states are `RUNNING`, `THROTTLED`, `PAUSED_FOR_RUNTIME`, `BUDGET_WAIT` and `ERROR`.
- Strategy promotion requires at least 300 trades, multiple chronological windows, more than one market, acceptable drawdown/overfitting, positive benchmark-relative evidence and measured out-of-sample improvement over the active baseline.
- Replay, walk-forward and paper-forward evidence remain separate. Replay output is not live alpha.

Key environment controls:

```text
BLUM_REPLAY_TRAINING_ENABLED=true
BLUM_REPLAY_TRAINING_MINUTES=15
BLUM_REPLAY_TARGET_VALIDATED_TRADES_PER_DAY=5000
BLUM_REPLAY_MAX_SECONDS_PER_CYCLE=120
BLUM_REPLAY_MAX_ASSETS_PER_CYCLE=20
BLUM_REPLAY_MAX_TRADES_PER_CYCLE=500
BLUM_REPLAY_MAX_EXPERIMENTS_PER_CYCLE=5
BLUM_REPLAY_MIN_PROMOTION_SAMPLES=300
BLUM_REPLAY_MARKETS=UNITED STATES,USA,ITALY,GERMANY,FRANCE,EUROPE
BLUM_REPLAY_TIMEFRAMES=1d,15m,5m,1m
```

The 5,000-trade daily value is a target, not a claimed result. Training Ground exposes measured daily throughput and the exact reason whenever verified data, eligible setups or runtime budgets prevent reaching it.

## Live Intraday Paper Scalping Engine

BLUM can promote replay-validated strategies into a separate intraday paper-forward stream. Promotion requires `PROMOTED_TO_PAPER`, at least 300 validated trades, positive benchmark-relative expectancy, acceptable stability and overfitting risk, and the exact `1d -> 15m -> 5m -> 1m` stack.

The scheduled `intraday_paper_trading` worker and explicit `POST /api/paper-forward/run-intraday` command:

- discover supported USA and European assets through enabled market desk agents;
- require fresh real bars on all four timeframes, with no interpolation or timeframe fallback;
- apply regime, setup, confirmation, trigger, liquidity, volatility, session, execution-cost and concentration gates;
- use volatility- and risk-adjusted fractional paper sizing;
- model adverse spread, slippage and commission fills;
- manage positions only from later one-minute bars and close on stop, invalidation, target, trailing stop, time stop or market close;
- create forward-only learning evidence after a trade is closed, never while it is open.

`GET /api/paper-forward/snapshot` is read-only and explains current activity or its exact blocker. `GET /api/alpha/snapshot` reports `intraday_paper_forward` separately from replay, walk-forward and generic paper-forward evidence. Empty streams return `NO_DATA` with null metrics; they are never backfilled from replay results.

Key controls include `BLUM_INTRADAY_PAPER_ENABLED`, `BLUM_INTRADAY_PAPER_MINUTES`, `BLUM_INTRADAY_MAX_ASSETS_PER_RUN`, `BLUM_INTRADAY_MAX_RUNTIME_SECONDS`, `BLUM_INTRADAY_MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS`, `BLUM_INTRADAY_MAX_HOLDING_MINUTES`, `BLUM_INTRADAY_MIN_EXPECTED_MOVE_BPS`, `BLUM_INTRADAY_MIN_LIQUIDITY_SCORE` and `BLUM_INTRADAY_MAX_ONE_MINUTE_AGE_MINUTES`.

This engine is paper-only. It has no broker integration, performs no real-money execution and does not force trades when promotion, data or execution-quality gates fail.

## Alpha Strategy Factory and Realistic Execution

BLUM now treats strategy research as a bounded scientific pipeline rather than promoting a setup from an attractive backtest. The scheduled `alpha_strategy_factory` worker generates deterministic variants across momentum, trend, breakout, pullback, mean reversion, volatility expansion, event reaction, relative strength, cross-sectional ranking and intraday scalping families. It evaluates persisted point-in-time replay evidence and records every rejection, challenger and reversible champion promotion.

Promotion requires at least 300 evaluated trades, purged chronological folds with embargo, positive net expectancy and benchmark excess, a positive block-bootstrap lower bound, multiple-testing significance, acceptable Deflated Sharpe and backtest-overfitting probabilities, multi-window/market/regime stability, controlled drawdown, complete execution-cost coverage and non-concentrated P/L. A stored `PROMOTED_TO_PAPER` row is not sufficient by itself: the paper registry accepts only an active champion certified by `alpha_strategy_factory_v1`. Strategies awaiting more samples are automatically reconsidered when replay evidence grows.

Approved intraday candidates now enter a separate persisted order lifecycle. Signals create `paper_execution_orders`; only later stored market bars can create `paper_execution_fills`. The execution model preserves theoretical and executed prices separately and records spread, liquidity-sensitive dynamic slippage, commission, volume participation, latency, FX conversion cost, short borrow cost and gap-through-stop loss. It supports partial fills, expires unfilled orders, opens a partial position when an executed remainder is cancelled at expiry, and never invents a same-timestamp fill.

Market sessions and provider halt metadata are execution gates. Regular-session orders cannot fill from opening/closing-auction bars unless the frozen order explicitly permits that session. Halted bars never fill. Intraday positions close at the next session by default; overnight carrying is an explicit opt-in. Cross-currency orders use only a stored point-in-time FX bar at or before the decision timestamp and are rejected with `FX_RATE_UNAVAILABLE` when that evidence is absent. Short orders similarly require a borrow-rate observation instead of assuming free borrow.

No-trade decisions with an observable reference price are persisted in `intraday_no_trade_decisions` and evaluated only after their configured future horizon. The resulting evidence distinguishes `CORRECT_NO_TRADE`, `MISSED_OPPORTUNITY`, `EDGE_DESTROYED_BY_COSTS` and `SIGNAL_DECAY_BEFORE_ENTRY`; expired executable orders remain separately classified as `ORDER_NOT_FILLED`. These outcomes update strategy memory and learning evidence without pretending that an unfilled order was a trade.

Runtime and UI boundaries:

- `hyperbolic_replay_training` produces historical evidence in bounded background slices.
- `alpha_strategy_factory` certifies or rejects strategies every configured interval.
- `intraday_paper_trading` discovers new paper candidates.
- `paper_execution_lifecycle` advances persisted orders and open positions independently.
- Training and Paper Forward snapshots expose compact `strategy_factory` and `execution_reality` summaries; GET requests do not run research or execution.

Relevant controls are `BLUM_STRATEGY_FACTORY_ENABLED`, `BLUM_STRATEGY_FACTORY_MINUTES`, `BLUM_STRATEGY_FACTORY_MAX_VARIANTS_PER_FAMILY`, `BLUM_STRATEGY_FACTORY_SEED`, `BLUM_PAPER_EXECUTION_LIFECYCLE_MINUTES`, `BLUM_PAPER_EXECUTION_ACCOUNT_CURRENCY`, `BLUM_PAPER_EXECUTION_FX_SPREAD_BPS`, `BLUM_INTRADAY_ALLOW_OVERNIGHT` and `BLUM_INTRADAY_NO_TRADE_EVALUATION_MINUTES`.

This architecture accelerates evidence production, not promotion. A high rejection rate is expected. Replay evidence remains distinct from paper-forward evidence, all fills are simulated research records, and no broker or real-money path exists.

## Evidence, Trust and Copy Readiness Engine

BLUM measures whether a strategy has enough reproducible evidence to be copied in paper research. The engine keeps four evidence classes strictly separate: `REPLAY_EVIDENCE`, `WALK_FORWARD_EVIDENCE`, `PAPER_FORWARD_EVIDENCE` and `INTRADAY_FORWARD_EVIDENCE`. Replay results can support research, but cannot by themselves promote a strategy to copy-ready status.

The background/command path appends immutable evidence cards, readiness history and lifecycle events. Read paths never recalculate:

- `GET /api/copy-readiness/strategies` returns a paginated latest-state projection.
- `GET /api/copy-readiness/strategies/{strategy_id}` returns readiness plus separated evidence cards.
- `GET /api/copy-readiness/strategies/{strategy_id}/timeline` returns a bounded audit timeline.
- `POST /api/copy-readiness/recalculate` is the explicit, bounded projection command and refreshes compact Paper Forward and Alpha snapshots.
- `GET /api/alpha/snapshot` and `GET /api/paper-forward/snapshot` consume stored readiness projections; neither starts learning, lifecycle work or recalculation.

Default paper-copy promotion requires at least 100 global terminal forward trades, 30 terminal trades for the strategy, 90 observation days, positive net expectancy and benchmark excess, drawdown at or below 15%, replay-to-forward decay at or below 35%, five tickers, two regimes and controlled concentration. High-confidence and limited-external-validation classifications use stricter thresholds (300/100/180 and 500/150/270 respectively). Every threshold is configurable with the `COPY_READINESS_*`, `COPY_READINESS_HIGH_CONFIDENCE_*` and `LIMITED_EXTERNAL_VALIDATION_*` environment variables.

Trade snapshots expose the evidence status, forward sample, net edge after measured costs, benchmark context, concentration, invalidation and paper-risk ceiling. Missing benchmark, cost or data-quality evidence remains `null` and blocks promotion where required; it is never converted to a favorable zero.

`ELIGIBLE_FOR_LIMITED_EXTERNAL_VALIDATION` is an autonomous research classification only. The engine has no broker adapter, order submission path or real-money execution. It does not promise alpha, does not blend replay with forward results and does not modify a trade's frozen decision payload.

## Brain Learning Proof

The Brain page measures whether BLUM is learning and whether stored paper decisions are improving. It still performs one read-only call to `GET /api/brain/snapshot`; no training, lifecycle work or benchmark recalculation runs during page render.

The snapshot and UI expose four compact evidence views:

- **Brain Improvement**: Brain Score, Decision Quality and Learning Velocity over timestamped stored snapshots.
- **P/L vs Benchmark**: cumulative paper-forward net P/L, matched holding-period benchmark contribution, wins, losses, expectancy R and drawdown.
- **Learning Throughput**: predictions, evaluated outcomes and persistent memory updates per bounded learning cycle.
- **Copy Trading Gate**: forward sample, observation time, maturity, readiness, capital eligibility, blockers and the next evidence milestone.

Missing values remain unavailable and short samples are marked `Insufficient evidence`. Charts never synthesize an improving line from one observation. Historical replay, walk-forward and paper-forward evidence remain separate.

### Evidence acceleration

BLUM projects a new Brain Score snapshot only when the stored learning or trading evidence changes. A stable evidence fingerprint prevents scheduler retries from creating duplicate history, while productive professional and replay cycles publish their result in the background. The five-snapshot directional threshold is unchanged: the chart becomes populated faster through real learning events, not synthetic points.

The scheduled paper-forward worker now performs two bounded phases in order: candidate scouting with frozen point-in-time evidence, followed by lifecycle advancement. Every opened position receives a deterministic time stop derived from the frozen trade plan and capped by `PAPER_FORWARD_MAX_HOLDING_DAYS` (10 days by default). Existing open positions without an expiration are backfilled from their original open timestamp, so they cannot remain unresolved indefinitely.

These changes do not lower the 30 closed-trade copy-readiness threshold and do not turn replay outcomes into forward evidence. Stops, targets, invalidations and time exits still require stored market prices after the frozen decision timestamp.

BLUM does not target an impossible 100% winning-trade rate. A robust trading-research system can have controlled losing trades; professional evidence requires positive net expectancy after costs, acceptable drawdown, benchmark-relative performance, calibration, reproducibility and enough forward observations. Copy readiness is an evidence-maturity status, not a guarantee of future profit or permission to deploy real capital.

## Limitations

- Public RSS, Google News RSS search, Yahoo and Stooq are demo-grade public data sources, not licensed institutional feeds.
- SEC EDGAR current feeds are public filing evidence. They do not cover private-company rumor, expected listings without filings or licensed IPO calendars.
- The system does not generate synthetic prices. If public providers fail or rate-limit, the affected assets are reported as missing instead of being filled with fake data.
- FinBERT, embeddings and LLM model loading depend on runtime memory and Hugging Face model availability.
- Qwen3-VL and InternVL3 chart vision are optional because multimodal models can exceed CPU Space resources. Deterministic OHLCV technical analysis remains active without them.
- The reasoning layer must not invent data; it is constrained to retrieved evidence.
- Signal classifications are research triage outputs, not investment recommendations.
- PostgreSQL is the database layer; the Docker demo can start an embedded PostgreSQL instance for Hugging Face convenience.
