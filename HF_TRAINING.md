# BLUM Hugging Face Champion–Challenger Operations

BLUM uses the Space as a controlled orchestrator. The Space prepares validated dataset snapshots and records state; GPU fine-tuning, evaluation, promotion, and rollback run in separate Hugging Face Jobs.

## Safety model

- Requests to the Space never update model weights.
- Only export-ready examples with acceptable quality, valid provenance, and matured outcomes enter a snapshot.
- Thesis lineages are deduplicated and assigned to one deterministic split.
- The training job writes only to `Italianhype/Blum-Finance-4B-Challenger`.
- The champion remains unchanged until a manual authenticated promotion.
- Every promotion creates a rollback tag on the previous champion.
- The MLX model is converted only from a promoted BF16 champion.

## Dependency

Merge the following dependency into the existing root `requirements.txt`:

```text
huggingface-hub>=1.16.1,<2
```

The GPU Jobs install PyTorch, Transformers, TRL, PEFT, Datasets, Accelerate, and bitsandbytes inside the default Hugging Face `uv` runtime through the PEP 723 headers in `scripts/`. Leave `BLUM_HF_TRAINING_IMAGE` empty unless the custom image explicitly contains the `uv` executable.

## Required Space secrets

Configure these as Hugging Face Space secrets, not normal variables:

```text
HF_TOKEN=<fine-grained write token with Jobs and repository access>
BLUM_HF_TRAINING_ADMIN_KEY=<long random administrative key>
```

The token needs access to:

- `Italianhype/Blum-Finance-Reasoning`;
- `Italianhype/Blum-Finance-4B-Challenger`;
- `Italianhype/Blum-Finance-4B` for explicit promotion and rollback;
- Hugging Face Jobs under the `Italianhype` account.

The Space stores only remote Job identifiers and repository revisions. It never persists `HF_TOKEN`.

## Recommended first deployment

Deploy the code with external work disabled:

```text
BLUM_HF_TRAINING_ENABLED=false
BLUM_HF_TRAINING_AUTO_LAUNCH=false
BLUM_HF_TRAINING_SCHEDULER_ENABLED=false
```

Confirm the Space starts and the Alembic revision is `0025_tg_runtime_snap`, not the overlong `0025_trading_game_runtime_snapshots`.

Inspect readiness:

```bash
curl https://<space-host>/api/analyst/hf-training/status
```

Generate a local dry-run manifest without writing to the Hub:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://<space-host>/api/analyst/hf-training/snapshot?publish=false'
```

After reviewing counts and rejection reasons, enable controlled external operations:

```text
BLUM_HF_TRAINING_ENABLED=true
BLUM_HF_TRAINING_AUTO_LAUNCH=false
BLUM_HF_TRAINING_SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true
BLUM_HF_TRAINING_SUPERVISOR_MINUTES=360
```

The scheduler synchronizes active remote Jobs. With `AUTO_LAUNCH=false`, it does not start a new paid GPU Job by itself.

## Manual cycle

Publish the immutable snapshot:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://<space-host>/api/analyst/hf-training/snapshot?publish=true'
```

Launch the challenger:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://<space-host>/api/analyst/hf-training/launch'
```

Synchronize training and evaluation state:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://<space-host>/api/analyst/hf-training/sync'
```

When a job becomes `eligible`, promote it explicitly:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H 'X-BLUM-Admin-Key: <admin-key>' \
  'https://<space-host>/api/analyst/hf-training/promote/<job-id>'
```

Rollback to the saved champion tag:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H 'X-BLUM-Admin-Key: <admin-key>' \
  'https://<space-host>/api/analyst/hf-training/rollback/<job-id>?backup_tag=champion-backup-...'
```

## Initial gates

Defaults:

```text
BLUM_HF_TRAINING_MINIMUM_EXAMPLES=250
BLUM_HF_TRAINING_MINIMUM_MATURED_RATIO=0.80
BLUM_HF_TRAINING_MINIMUM_DAYS_BETWEEN_RUNS=30
BLUM_HF_TRAINING_MINIMUM_QUALITY=70
BLUM_HF_EVAL_MAX_EXAMPLES=53
BLUM_HF_TRAINING_HARDWARE=a10g-large
BLUM_HF_TRAINING_TIMEOUT=8h
```

A candidate cannot be promoted when it regresses aggregate contract score or no-fabrication performance, falls below structured-validity or directional-accounting gates, contains temporal leakage, or introduces a critical regression.

## Automatic launch

Enable only after several manually reviewed successful cycles:

```text
BLUM_HF_TRAINING_AUTO_LAUNCH=true
```

This enables automatic challenger launch after all readiness gates pass. It still does not enable automatic production promotion.

## Model lineage

The authoritative release order is:

```text
Italianhype/Blum-Finance-4B-Challenger@candidate-...
  → manual promotion
Italianhype/Blum-Finance-4B@main
  → verified MLX conversion
Italianhype/Blum
```

Record the BF16 champion commit in the MLX model card and conversion manifest so the two public model repositories cannot silently diverge.
